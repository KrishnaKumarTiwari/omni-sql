# OmniSQL: Universal SQL Across Enterprise Apps

OmniSQL is a high-performance federated query layer designed to query multiple enterprise SaaS applications at scale. It allows developers and data teams to treat their entire SaaS stack as a single, unified SQL database.

## 🎯 Architecture Rationale & Trade-offs

### 1. Federated On-Demand Execution
**Decision**: Real-time Query Layer over ETL/Warehousing.
- **Rationale**: Operational workflows (e.g., customer support, real-time risk assessment) cannot wait for hourly ETL syncs. OmniSQL prioritizes **freshness** over historical analysis depth.
- **Trade-off**: Higher complexity in managing heterogeneous SaaS rate limits and varied API response times.

### 2. Stateless Data Plane with "Just-In-Time" Caching
**Decision**: No persistent storage of source data.
- **Rationale**: Minimizes compliance surface (GDPR/CCPA/SOC2). Statelessness allows for effortless horizontal scaling and regional sharding to meet data residency requirements.
- **Trade-off**: Slightly higher P99 latencies for complex, un-cached cross-app joins.

### 3. Aggressive Predicate Pushdown
**Decision**: Push filtering/projection to the source API.
- **Rationale**: Minimizing data ingress is the primary way to achieve sub-second P50 latencies. We fetch only what is necessary.
- **Trade-off**: SQL richness is sometimes bounded by the capabilities of the underlying SaaS (e.g., non-indexed filters).

### 4. Hybrid Control/Data Plane (BYOC Support)
**Decision**: Decouple the query execution engine (Data Plane) from the management logic (Control Plane).
- **Rationale**: Large enterprises often require data to remain within their network. BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) is a first-class citizen.
- **Trade-off**: Significant engineering overhead in maintaining cross-cloud deployment automation.

## 🛠 Prototype Scenario
The current prototype demonstrates a cross-app join between **GitHub** and **Jira** to track the status of Pull Requests against their corresponding Jira Issues.

**Sample Query**:
```sql
SELECT gh.pr_id, gh.status, jira.issue_key, jira.status as jira_status
FROM github.pull_requests gh
JOIN jira.issues jira ON gh.branch = jira.branch_name
WHERE jira.status = 'In Progress'
```
